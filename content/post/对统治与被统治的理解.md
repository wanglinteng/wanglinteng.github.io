如果一定把人划分为不同的阶级，只有统治阶级和被统治阶级

人性决定了理想国不会存在

所谓政体、制度亦不过是统治阶级与被统治阶级博弈的结果

被统治阶级注定要被剥削

和动物世界的弱肉强食没什么本质区别

If people must be divided into different classes, there are only the ruling class and the ruled class

Human nature determines that the ideal country will not exist

The so-called regime and system are just the result of the struggle between the ruling class and the ruled class

The ruling class is doomed to exploitation

There is no essential difference from the law of the jungle in the animal world
